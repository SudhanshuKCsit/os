Shiva is known as "The Destroyer" 
within the Trimurti, 
the Hindu trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu.
[2][15] In the Shaivite tradition,
Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, 
protects and transforms the universe.[9][10][11] 
In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, 
the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is regarded as 
the energy and creative power (Shakti) and 
the equal complementary partner of Shiva.
